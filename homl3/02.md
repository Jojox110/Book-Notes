# Starting a machine learning project
https://github.com/ageron/handson-ml3/blob/main/02_end_to_end_machine_learning_project.ipynb

See appendix_a.md for ML project checklist

## Frame the problem
Signal: "A piece of information fed to a machine learning sytstem is often called a *signal*"

Pipeline: A series of data processing components. See p.42

-> Doing this allows you to have a better idea of what you're being asked to do and how you will complete the task

-> Getting a better idea of why you are being asked to do said task will help you plan

## Select a performance mesure

### Notations:
- m = the number of instances in the dataset
- x(i) is a vector containing the information about the features
- y(i) contains the label
- X is a matrix that contains all the feature values
- h is the system's prediction system

## RMSE
See p.43 for equation

RMSE is an equation that calculates the performance of a model, but is usually used in regression tasks. RMSE follows the l2 norm and will give a higher weight to bigger errors

In more details, RMSE uses the Euclidian distance to calculate the distance between the target vector and the prediction vector.

## MAE
See p.45 for equation

Just like RMSE, MAE calculates the distance between the prediction vector and the target vector, but it uses the Manhattan distance instead. MAE is also an l1 norm, which means it doesn't give as much weight to bigger errors like RMSE does.

## lk norms
-> What is the letter? Weird p or weird cursive l ??

When talking about lk norms, a higher index, k, means that the function will give more weight to bigger errors, and the opposite for a smaller k. Which one you will use depends on what exactly you're trying to measure.

## Downloading the data using an automated Python function
```py
from pathlib import Path
import pandas as pd
import tarfile
import urllib.request

def load_housing_data():
    tarball_path = Path("datasets/housing.tgz")
    if not tarball_path.is_file():
        Path("datasets").mkdir(parents=True, exist_ok=True)
        url = "https://github.com/ageron/data/raw/main/housing.tgz"
        urllib.request.urlretrieve(url, tarball_path)  # Download the data
        with tarfile.open(tarball_path) as housing_tarball:
            housing_tarball.extractall(path="datasets") # Extract from the tar.gz
    return pd.read_csv(Path("datasets/housing/housing.csv"))

housing = load_housing_data() # Load into a pd dataframe
```
